# Sigil SDK — Specifications

All significant features must begin as a specification before implementation.

Spec lifecycle:
1. Draft
2. Review
3. Accepted
4. Implemented
5. Deprecated (if needed)

Each spec must define:
- Problem
- Constraints
- Acceptance Criteria
- Public API impact
- Versioning implications
- Security considerations
